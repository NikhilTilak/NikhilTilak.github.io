I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers University in [Prof. Eva Andrei](https://physics.rutgers.edu/people/faculty-list/faculty-profile/andrei-eva-y)'s group. My research focusses on the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as [Graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene) and   [Molybdenum Disulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum_disulfide). I have been focussing on creating marginally twisted heterostructures from these materials and studying them using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and other experimental techniques. You can checkout some of my published peer-reviewed works on my [google-scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ehlgV_0AAAAJ&hl=en).  

I am also an avid programmer and a student of Data Science. My intrest in Machine Learning techniques grew exponentially when I took part in the Erdos Institute Data Bootcamp. My team of four won first place out of twenty-six teams in the final-project competition at the end of the bootcamp. You can checkout our winning project [here](https://github.com/data-dart/bookend).

I have encorporated many of these techniques in my research. For instance, I used a clustering algorithm on some STM image data to extract the locations of specific sites of interest. Doing this manually would have taken days instead of seconds. 

More recently I have dived into the world of Deep Learning by exploring datasets and notebooks on Kaggle and have even tried my hand at some competitions. 

Some of my other fun projects include [BrewXplorer](https://brewxplorer2.herokuapp.com/), an interactive app which lets you explore 3000+ breweries in the United States.
