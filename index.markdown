<h3>Hello! My name is Nikhil Tilak.</h3>
<h4>I'm wrapping up a PhD in physics, and am looking for new opportunities at the intersection of Physics, Mathematics, and Data Science. To learn more about me, see the tabs above or check out my resume.</h4>

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers University in [Prof. Eva Andrei](https://physics.rutgers.edu/people/faculty-list/faculty-profile/andrei-eva-y)'s group. My research focusses on the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as [Graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene) and   [Molybdenum Disulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum_disulfide). Most recently I have been studying devices made from marginally twisted heterostructures made from these materials and probing them using my homebuilt Scanning Tunneling Microscope and other experimental techniques. You can checkout some of my published peer-reviewed works on my [google-scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ehlgV_0AAAAJ&hl=en) or checkout my research page above. 

I am also an avid programmer and a student of data science. My interest in Machine Learning techniques grew exponentially when I took part in the [Erdos Institute Data Bootcamp](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/code) in 2020. My team won first place out of twenty-six teams in the final-project competition at the end of the bootcamp. You can checkout our winning project [here](https://github.com/data-dart/bookend) or look at the data projects page. 

I have encorporated many of these techniques in my research. For instance, I used a clustering algorithm on STM image data to extract the locations of specific sites of interest and then did a polynomial background extraction at every location. Doing this manually would have taken days instead of seconds. 

More recently I have dived into the world of Deep Learning by exploring datasets and notebooks on Kaggle and have even tried my hand at competitions. 

My most recent project is a [Sudoku-Solver](https://github.com/NikhilTilak/sudoku-solver) which lets you take an image of a Sudoku puzzle and generates a solution using some custom built image processing pipelines and a combination of deep learning and OCR. 

Some of my other fun projects include [BrewXplorer](https://brewxplorer2.herokuapp.com/), an interactive app which lets you explore 3000+ breweries in the United States.
