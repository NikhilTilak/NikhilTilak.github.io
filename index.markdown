<h3>Hello! My name is Nikhil Tilak. Thanks for visiting my website.</h3>


I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers University in [Prof. Eva Andrei](https://physics.rutgers.edu/people/faculty-list/faculty-profile/andrei-eva-y)'s group. My research focusses on the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as [Graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene) and   [Molybdenum Disulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum_disulfide). My research involves creating marginally twisted heterostructures from these materials and studying them using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and other experimental techniques. You can checkout some of my published peer-reviewed works on my [google-scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ehlgV_0AAAAJ&hl=en).  

I am also an avid programmer and a student of data science. My interest in Machine Learning techniques grew exponentially when I took part in the [Erdos Institute Data Bootcamp](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/code) in 2020. My team won first place out of twenty-six teams in the final-project competition at the end of the bootcamp. You can checkout our winning project [here](https://github.com/data-dart/bookend) or look at the data projects page.

I have encorporated many of these techniques in my research. For instance, I used a clustering algorithm on some STM image data to extract the locations of specific sites of interest and then did a polynomial background extraction at every location. Doing this manually would have taken days instead of seconds. 

More recently I have dived into the world of Deep Learning by exploring datasets and notebooks on Kaggle and have even tried my hand at competitions. 

Some of my other fun projects include [BrewXplorer](https://brewxplorer2.herokuapp.com/), an interactive app which lets you explore 3000+ breweries in the United States.

I will be defending soon. Given the broad range of skills and experiences I have gained during my PhD, I am currently looking for positions which are at the intersection of Physics, Mathematics and data science.
