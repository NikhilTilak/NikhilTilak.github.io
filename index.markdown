      <h1>Hello! My name is Nikhil Tilak.</h1>
      <p>I’m a Postdoctoral associate in Physics at Rutgers University with 8+ years of experience in nanofabrication of devices and their
characterization via electronic tunneling and transport measurements. I’m a quick-learner who thrives in a collaborative environment. I’m highly skilled at designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting findings as evidenced by my 6 peer-reviewed journal publications and conference talks. Additionally, I am experienced in numerical and machine learning techniques using Python and am always working to expand my skill set. I’m currently seeking process/yield engineering roles in
the semiconductor industry and data scientist/analyst positions <br>
      My CV is linked above. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email if you have a suitable opportunity and would like to know more.</p>
